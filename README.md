The relentless pursuit of highly reliable communication systems demands research and development of algorithms capable of identifying and correcting errors that may occur during data transmission and storage. Reliability is even more critical in critical systems and/or those that are difficult to access, such as space, passenger transportation, and finance. In this scenario, the Error Correction Code (ECC) is a fundamental tool to provide a certain degree of reliability to systems. This work proposes a new technique to increase the error correction capacity of ECCs based on region overlapping. More specifically, we propose correcting data areas protected by more than one ECC, allowing for the inference of logic correlating ECCs, thus enhancing their error detection and correction capability. The work focuses on bidimensional codeword organizations, known as 2D-ECCs, which constitute a hierarchical arrangement of ECCs. The proposed overlapping approach will be evaluated in some 2D organizations, comparing error correction and detection capabilities, scalability, and reliability.
